## Magic: The Gathering Jumpstart Cube Constructor

An intelligent deck construction system that automatically builds themed Magic: The Gathering Jumpstart cubes with perfect theme coherence and balanced gameplay from any card pool. This project features automated theme extraction, balanced color distribution, and comprehensive performance analysis.

**Key bits of fun:**
- **Theme Extraction:** Automatically discovers themes from card pools using advanced keyword analysis
- **Specialized Scoring Integration:** Purpose-built scorers for different strategies (Equipment, Tribal, Control, Aggro) that understand specific gameplay patterns
- **Auto-Download System:** Zero-setup experience with automatic MTG data management and caching

**Technical Implementation:**

- **Technologies:** Python, Pandas, Jupyter, Machine Learning, Data Analysis
- **Architecture:** Modular 5-phase construction algorithm with constraint management
- **Output:** Comprehensive analysis including performance metrics, improvement suggestions, and exportable data

This was an experiment in "vibe coding" that solved a real problem I had at the time - the end result came out better than expected. The system can build themed cubes from any card pool without manually defining themes, while maintaining high theme coherence and balanced gameplay.
