## Magic: The Gathering Jumpstart Cube Constructor

An intelligent deck construction system that automatically builds themed Magic: The Gathering Jumpstart cubes with perfect theme coherence and balanced gameplay from any card pool. This project features automated theme extraction, balanced color distribution, and comprehensive performance analysis.

**Key bits of fun:**
- **Theme Extraction:** Automatically discovers themes from card pools using advanced keyword analysis
- **Specialized Scoring Integration:** Purpose-built scorers for different strategies (Equipment, Tribal, Control, Aggro) that understand specific gameplay patterns
- **Auto-Download System:** Zero-setup experience with automatic MTG data management and caching

**Technical Implementation:**

- **Technologies:** Python, Pandas, Jupyter, Machine Learning, Data Analysis
- **Architecture:** Modular 5-phase construction algorithm with constraint management
- **Output:** Comprehensive analysis including performance metrics, improvement suggestions, and exportable data

This was an experiment in "vibe coding" that solved a real problem I had at the time - the end result came out better than expected. The system can build themed cubes from any card pool without manually defining themes, while maintaining high theme coherence and balanced gameplay.

## Table Mountain HEMA Website

Created an affordable website for a HEMA club using Jekyll and GitHub Pages, focusing on cost-effective hosting and maintenance. I have now handed this over to the club and they have been running with it ever since.

**Technologies:** Jekyll, GitHub, Ruby

## Currently Iterating On

### Horizon's Edge

![splash](/assets/splash.png)

A tactical wargame built in Godot exploring floating islands locked in conflict. What started as a simple board game prototype evolved into a digital game with procedural island generation, sophisticated combat systems, and height-based tactical gameplay.

**Current Features:**
- Isometric hex-based grid with procedural island generation using Wave Function Collapse
- Real-time tactical combat with specialized unit abilities (blink mechanics, ranged attacks)
- Dynamic road networks with 3D models and rotation
- Playable prototypes for both board game and digital versions

**Technologies:** Godot, GDScript, Procedural Generation, Game Design
