I'm Peter, a South African engineer living in the UK with a passion for building fast, resilient systems and helping others grow along the way. I work at the intersection of backend engineering, cloud infrastructure, and developer experience, with a love for clean code, TDD, and collaborative problem solving.

In past lives, I've helped architect high-performance APIs, lead platform migrations, and driven culture shifts toward better engineering practices. I get excited by elegant abstractions, meaningful metrics, and mentoring other engineers to do their best work.

Outside of work, I'm a lifelong Doctor Who fan, avid board gamer, and book devourer. I'm currently trying to teach myself urban sketching (with questionable success), and I still get emotional over great video game storytelling. I live in London with my wife and daughter, where we're figuring out the whole parenting thing one messy, wonderful day at a time.

Let's build something great, and maybe a little weird, together.

**Current Role:** Staff Engineer at The Economist 

**Location:** London, England, United Kingdom  

**Years of Experience:** 14+ years in software engineering and technical leadership  

## Notable Accomplishments

- **Performance Excellence:** Delivered 200%+ performance gains through CloudFront caching implementation at The Economist
- **International Expansion:** Enabled Cazoo's expansion into France, Germany, Italy, and Spain through architecture internationalization
- **Team Development:** Successfully mentored multiple engineers to senior levels with quality-first mindset
- **Technical Leadership:** Championed TDD, clean-code, and collaborative practices across engineering teams, across multiple companies.
- **Community Involvement:** Volunteer Conference Organizer for PyConZa (Python Software Society for South Africa)

## Personal Projects

### Magic: The Gathering Jumpstart Cube Constructor

An intelligent deck construction system that automatically builds themed Magic: The Gathering Jumpstart cubes with perfect theme coherence and balanced gameplay from any card pool. This project features automated theme extraction, balanced color distribution, and comprehensive performance analysis.

**Key bits of fun:**
- **Theme Extraction:** Automatically discovers themes from card pools using advanced keyword analysis
- **Specialized Scoring Integration:** Purpose-built scorers for different strategies (Equipment, Tribal, Control, Aggro) that understand specific gameplay patterns
- **Auto-Download System:** Zero-setup experience with automatic MTG data management and caching

**Technical Implementation:**

- **Technologies:** Python, Pandas, Jupyter, Machine Learning, Data Analysis
- **Architecture:** Modular 5-phase construction algorithm with constraint management
- **Output:** Comprehensive analysis including performance metrics, improvement suggestions, and exportable data

This was an experiment in "vibe coding" that solved a real problem I had at the time - the end result came out better than expected. The system can build themed cubes from any card pool without manually defining themes, while maintaining high theme coherence and balanced gameplay.

**Live Example:** [Pauper Jumpstart Cube](https://cubecobra.com/cube/list/pauper-jumpstart-06-2025)

### Table Mountain HEMA Website 

Created an affordable website for a HEMA club using Jekyll and GitHub Pages, focusing on cost-effective hosting and maintenance. I have now handed this over to the club and they have been running with it ever since.

**Technologies:** Jekyll, GitHub, Ruby
