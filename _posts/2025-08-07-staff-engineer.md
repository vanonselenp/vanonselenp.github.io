*Originally written as an internal working spec while I was at Cazoo, this post is my take on the responsibilities and mindset of a Staff Engineer. It helped me reflect on what the role requires — not just in terms of technical ability, but also leadership, communication, and constant adaptation.*

## Introduction

The Staff Engineer role can feel nebulous. It’s not quite management, but it’s also not just "Senior Engineer, but more so." When I stepped into the role, I found myself constantly questioning: *What should I be focusing on? What does success look like?*

To answer that, I wrote down what I believed the role should encompass. This post is the cleaned-up version of that spec — part philosophy, part operating manual.

## The Role in a Nutshell

A Staff Software Engineer brings advanced technical skill *and* a strong sense of quality, leadership, and communication. It’s a role that blends design thinking, mentoring, business context, and servant leadership.

This is someone who:

- Drives technical excellence.
- Guides teams without pulling rank.
- Mentors and grows engineers around them.
- Communicates fluently across technical and non-technical domains.
- Keeps one foot in the code, and one in the strategy.

## Core Tenets

These are the pillars that, in my view, define the role.

### 1. Servant Leadership

The Staff Engineer leads *by enabling others*. They remove obstacles, give context, and help teammates succeed — without needing to be the loudest or most visible person in the room.

### 2. Mentoring and Coaching

They actively help other engineers grow — sharing experience, offering feedback, and creating space for others to step up.

### 3. Advanced Technical Skills & Quality Focus

In my case, this included deep expertise in:

- TypeScript
- AWS Lambda and the Serverless Framework
- TDD and BDD practices

But more importantly, it meant advocating for a “Shift Left” approach — tackling quality early, writing strong tests, and building confidence into the development process.

### 4. Software Architecture

The Staff Engineer should be able to design scalable, secure, serverless systems — understanding trade-offs, constraints, and how to align architecture with business needs.

### 5. Problem Solving

This means breaking down complexity, identifying root causes, and coming up with solutions that work in real-world systems — not just whiteboard diagrams.

### 6. Communication

A key part of the role is acting as a bridge — translating technical ideas for stakeholders, and helping engineers understand the “why” behind the work.

### 7. Domain Understanding

Good decisions require context. A Staff Engineer needs to understand the business domain deeply enough to make trade-offs that serve real user and company needs.

## The Mindset: Be Less Wrong Over Time

I tried to approach the role with a Bayesian mindset: always updating my understanding based on new evidence. In practice, this meant:

- Re-evaluating what’s most important, constantly.
- Adjusting plans as work reveals new complexity.
- Changing approach based on feedback.
- Keeping a habit of continuous learning.

This mindset helped me stay adaptive and avoid getting stuck in "default" thinking.

## Measuring Impact

Performance at this level can’t be measured by ticket output. Instead, I think about impact across these dimensions:

- **Business outcomes**: Are you driving results that matter?
- **Team enablement**: Is the team more productive because you’re on it?
- **Mentorship**: Are others levelling up with your help?
- **Communication**: Can stakeholders understand you — and trust your judgement?
- **Learning and adaptability**: Are you growing faster than the problems are changing?
- **Problem-solving**: Are you taking on the hard, messy challenges?
- **Team feedback**: Do your peers want to work with you again?
- **Stakeholder trust**: Do people outside the team rely on you?

No single metric tells the full story. But together, they can indicate whether you’re making a difference.

## Final Thoughts

This spec isn't meant to be definitive — just a personal take. The Staff Engineer role will always vary based on the team, company, and product. But having a compass — a sense of what good looks like — has helped me stay focused on the kind of impact I want to have.

If you’re stepping into a Staff+ role, or just thinking about it, I hope this helps spark some ideas.
