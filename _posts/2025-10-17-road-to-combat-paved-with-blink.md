# Tangents, Roads, and Blinking Archers

okay okay okay, so I *know* last time I was all:

> “I am going to work on the combat system.”

and I meant it. I really did.

I started the week’s development figuring out how to get a second creature working — this time one that could *shoot*! and it shot! with animation! and a lovely red number floating overhead when it hit.

Then I spent some time trying to convince the AI to make an archer… which came out as a cylinder and a torus mashed together like some long-lost relic from *Lord of the Rings*.

Somewhere between the floating numbers and cursed geometry, I ran into a movement bug where the creature could only move *upwards* but never *downwards* — so, you know, just another normal day working on a game with a super-powered AI as a pair.

And that’s the problem with having a super-powered AI as a pair: it is *beyond* exceedingly simple to wander off on completely unrelated tangents. Which is, of course, what I did.

## The Tangent: Shiny Hexes ✨

When I was working through a game dev course on [Jumpstart to 2D Game Development: Godot 4.4+ for Beginners](https://www.udemy.com/course/jumpstart-to-2d-game-development-godot-4-for-beginners/) last year, I came across a really cool site: [kenney.nl](https://kenney.nl/).

They’ve got models, textures, and all sorts of game assets. And wouldn’t you know it, I found a bunch of hex models that perfectly matched the vibe in my head.

And just like that, all thoughts of combat systems and specs and rational planning *evaporated*.

No, now was *obviously* the perfect time to get models and textures in. So I immediately downloaded the GLB files and started plugging them into my wave function collapse algorithms.

Instant vibe shift. The world suddenly *looked* like something. I’m not using all the models yet… but give me time 😄.

## The Roads to Madness 🛣️

With proper models in hand, I finally turned to something that’s been quietly tormenting me for weeks: roads.

Now that I had actual path models to work with, I thought this was going to be a cinch.

Nope. No. Oh hell no.

This is the kind of task that is *inherently infuriating* to get an AI to handle. Its sense of direction doesn’t match the way the world is rendered, and trying to explain rotations in a way that makes sense to both of us is like trying to teach a goldfish to drive.

And if the AI ever *accidentally* gets something right, it will immediately overwrite it in the next change. Because of course it will.

My eventual workflow:

* Get the AI to build the big stuff — toggles, switches, base structure.
* Then manually go through and tweak everything myself.

Thank god for Git and my obsession with [save scumming](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveScumming) my way back to a sensible state.

## Meanwhile… Combat System? 🫣

Hang on though.
Wasn’t I working on a *combat system*?
Damn it.

Okay, where was I?

Ah yes — my ever-growing planning folder to the rescue.

I’ve developed a habit of getting the AI to output the result of any long feature discussion into a spec or planning file that gets committed into the repo.

Which is how I ended up with… about a dozen specs.

Some were implemented, some were “I realized this was a tangent and saved myself,” and some were very much still alive. After some reorganizing, I was down to a high level planning doc and a solid todo list that was a solid active plan.

```
➜  horizons-edge git:(main) ✗ ls planning/6-
6-implementation-todo.md
6-test-deck-archetypes-energy-abilities.md
```

Then came the fun part: getting the AI to validate how accurate my current TODO list was against the plan — and then, obviously, not trusting it at all and just starting to build anyway 😄.

## Back on Track: Blink ✨

At last, *finally*, I was back on combat system track.
And the first order of business: give my test creature a **blink ability**.

Let’s see how far I get next week.

Until then, I hope you’re enjoying whatever tangent is currently distracting you from your side project. I salute you, fellow tangent adventurers. 🫡
